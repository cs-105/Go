//Main function should output a welcome message to the user and then get user input for a topic. 
//Main should call the findText function to search online for a body of text relating to the specified topic.

//findText function should pass the topic in string form and return a relevant body of text found on the internet. This text is then parsed by textParser

//textParser should return the location and type of words that are being replaced

//main should then, for every word removed, request and retrive a word from the user of equivalent type, which are all checked by inputValue

//inputValue should prevent users from inputting a word of different type than the word that was removed

//insertWords should take the validated user inputs and pass them back into the body of text

//main then prints out the now edited body of text and asks the user if they would like to do another or quit
